This is the based on the SDL ( http://www.libsdl.org ) headers, and has been converted, comments and all, to the Pascal unit called sdl.pas.
Other conversions that have also been done are SDL_Mixer.h, SDL_Net.h, SDL_Image.h, SDL_ttf, SMPEG.h, SDL_sound and the SFont library, 
which are all included in this distribution.

It allows you to access all the functions within the SDL libraries under Windows, Linux and FreeBSD, so you can write cross-platform games or multimedia applications.

Installation Instructions
-------------------------
Windows - We now have a semi-automated setup under Windows ( thanks to David House and the Jedi JCL team ). 
           Once you have extracted the zip file, simply double click on the "JEDISDLWin32Installer.exe" to have the correct paths added to your respective 
           IDEs. All IDEs from Delphi 4 - 7 are supported and it also adds a link to the .CHM help file under the Tools menu.

Linux - Alternatively if you use Linux or want to to manually install the paths, then make sure you read the "Getting Started.html" file ( ideal for those who are new to JEDI-SDL ) and is now included as a guide to help getting everything setup for smooth compilation.

Also included is a guide of how to use Sourceforge using TortoiseCVS under Windows ( Linux guide is under development ).
Both documents can be found in the "documentation" directory.

Beta 4 : The JEDI-SDL home page is now located @ http://www.delphi-jedi.org/Jedi:TEAM_SDL_HOME
         All Demos ( including OpenGL Demos ) now compile under both Kylix and Delphi.
         I have added quite a few more OpenGL examples, we are now up to Nehe tutorial 12.
         All OpenGL demos also show how to handle Window resizing. 
         Included an OpenGL demo called Puntos by Gustavo Maximo.
         Ported Jan Horn's OpenGL MetaBalls and also SkyBox demo to SDL.
         Ported Ilkka Tuomioja's OpenGL Quake 2 Model Viewer/Animator to SDL. 
         NOTE : All OpenGL demos require OpenGL12.pas which can be found at...
         http://www.lischke-online.de/Graphics.html#OpenGL12
         I also fixed a conversion bug to do with SDL_MustLock and also a conversion omission to do with various events.
         Fixed a conversion bug with SDL_CDOpen ( as suggested on the mailing list ).
         Added the GetPixel and PuxPixel functions to the SDLUtils.pas file.
         Jason Farmer has donated SFont, a simple, yet effective Font library he converted for JEDI-SDL.
         It contains 4 Demos show how to best use it.
         Added TUInt8Array and PUIntArray to SDL.pas after suggestions from Matthias Thoma and Eric Grange.
         In the file area of the JEDI-SDL mailing list ( http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JEDI-SDL/files/DTTSrc/ there 
         is a fully functional 3D network game called DeathTruckTion v1.0 written by the TNTeam that makes use of 
         JEDI-SDL and is just too big to include with this distribution but is well worth looking at as it works under Windows and Linux!         
         Gustavo Maxima is working on translating the JEDI-SDL Documentation to Spanish and Portugese.
         The Mouse Demo has now been speeded up considerably and it is very responsive now.
         Dean Ellis will provide steps on how to compile the demos using the Free Pascal compiler.
         Jason Farmer and I are working on a series of Tutorials that should hopefully be out soon.
         David Aclan has donated a SMpeg component that should work under Kylix.
         Róbert Kisnémeth, has been hard at work, and has donated some new demos he has created with a SpriteEngine ( which he also donated ).
         He has also donated a couple of games called BlitzBomber and Oxygene ( which uses the SpriteEngine ) and added a couple of useful 
         functions to SDLUtils.pas.
         The Functions added are SDL_FlipV, SDL_FlipH, SDL_NewPutPixel ( assembler version ), SDL_AddPixel, SDL_SubPixel, SDL_DrawLine, SDL_AddLine,
         SDL_SubLine, SDL_AddSurface, SDL_SubSurface, SDL_MonoSurface & SDL_TexturedSurface.
         He has also donated a Font Blitting class and demo called SDL_MonoFonts which supports alignment like Left, Right and Center.
         He and Thomas are also working on a GUI library.
         Jason Farmer has donated a set of Image Filtering functions which add quite a few interesting effects. Check the SDL_Filter sub-directory for more 
         info.
         Christian Hackbart also donated an OpenGL BlockOut clone.
         

Beta 3 : I have added conversions for SDL_env.h, SDL_Mixer.h and SDL_Net.h while Matthias Thoma has added conversions for SDL_Image.h and SMPEG.h.
         This version is also SDL version 1.2.0 compliant.
         This release also adds demos for the SDL_Image, SDL_Mixer and SDL_Net libraries.
         There are now also some OpenGL demos that make some use of SDL as well as a demo on how to use the Mouse with Clickable regions.
         A conversion bug, that was pointed out by Clem Vasseur, has also been fixed.
         There is now a mailing list that has been set up at http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JEDI-SDL/join/ so we can all learn from each other how to use
         these libraries.
         Demos have not been unified into single .dpr files for each demo, thus showing how you would write a crossplatform game using only 1 .dpr file.
         There is also a documentation directory that is currently in HTML format. All code examples in the documentation have been converted to Object 
         Pascal but are untested.
         I Also fixed a few conversion bugs which I came across while converting the documentation.

Beta 2 : I have added  conversions for SDL_active.h, SDL_thread.h, SDL_mutex.h and 
         SDL_error.h, Matthias Thoma has added Linux Support and JEDI compliancy so these 
         units and examples are now x-platform and x-compiler compilable.
         I also added Tom Jones' SDLUtils.pas file;
         Matthias also cleaned up the 2 new demos and made them work on both Linux and 
         Windows.

Beta 1 : Initial Release;


There are now 5 examples included with this JEDI-SDL distribution. 
1. Is the TestWin application, which is based on the testwin application that comes with the SDL SDK, only my version has a gui front end to the options available and has been compiled under Delphi 4.03. It should be compatible with Delphi 3.0 onwards ( though Delphi 2 compatibility has not been tested ).

2. A Plasma example which was converted from one found on the Demos page of the SDL site.

3. A Voxel terrain following demo, which was converted from one found on the Demos page of the SDL site. This one should be of interest to others as it shows how to handle keyboard events when using SDL.

4. A Mouse handling demo that shows how to use transparency and clickable regions.

5. A Space Invaders style game called Aliens which shows the use of SDL, SDL_Image and SDL_Mixer. This game shows how to handle sound, keyboards and some basic collision detection. It is a conversion of one found on the SDL Demos page.

There are also 14 OpenGL demos that are based on the NeHe tutorials <nehe.gamedev.net>. The other 3 OpenGL demos are Jan Horns' OpenGL demo, A Quake 2 Model viewer that I ported and a Demo by Gustavo Maxima called Puntos.

If writing your own, just make sure that the SDL.pas file is in your projects path for compiling and that the SDL.dll file is in your path when running the compiled app.

Please test these units and report problems to the JEDI-SDL mailing list @ http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JEDI-SDL/ outlining steps under which the error occurred. If you convert any more demos please send them to me so that I can  
include them in the ditribution for others to learn from. 

Also if you are using these Units to write any games 
please let me know about it so that I can post the information to the http://www.DelphiGamer.com site.

The plan is to have this unit JEDI certified at some point so that it can be included on the Delphi and Kylix CDs, so all feedback is greatly welcomed.
