  (*
   * IMPORTANT: The official FFmpeg C headers change very quickly. Often some
   * of the data structures are changed so that they become incompatible with
   * older header files. The Pascal headers have to be adjusted to those changes,
   * otherwise the application might crash randomly or strange bugs (not
   * necessarily related to video or audio due to buffer overflows etc.) might
   * occur.
   *
   * In the past users reported problems with USDX that took hours to fix and
   * the problem was an unsupported version of FFmpeg. So we decided to disable
   * support for future versions of FFmpeg until the headers are revised by us
   * for that version as they otherwise most probably will break USDX.
   *
   * If the headers do not yet support your FFmpeg version you may want to
   * adjust the max. version numbers manually but please note: it may work but
   * in many cases it does not. The USDX team does NOT PROVIDE ANY SUPPORT
   * for the game if the MAX. VERSION WAS CHANGED.
   *
   * The only safe way to support new versions of FFmpeg is to add the changes
   * of the FFmpeg git repository C headers to the Pascal headers.
   * You can accelerate this process by posting a patch with the git changes
   * translated to Pascal to our bug tracker (please join our IRC chat before
   * you start working on it). Simply adjusting the max. versions is NOT a valid
   * fix.
