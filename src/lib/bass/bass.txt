What's the point?
=================
BASS is an audio library for use in software on several platforms. Its
purpose is to provide the powerful and efficient sample, stream, MOD
music, and recording functions. All in a compact DLL that won't overly
bloat your software.

See the documentation for descriptions of all the BASS functions. Also
check the included example source-codes for some examples of how to use
BASS in your own programs.


Requirements
============
Win32 version
-------------
BASS requires DirectSound for playback and recording, but decoding is still
possible without it. DirectSound has been included with all Windows versions
since Windows 98. 32-bit and 64-bit Windows are supported.

MacOSX version
--------------
BASS uses CoreAudio for playback and recording, so there are no special
library/driver requirements. 32-bit (i386) and 64-bit (x86_64) architectures
are supported in a single universal library. OSX 10.4 or above is
recommended.

Linux version
-------------
BASS requires ALSA for playback and recording, but decoding is still possible
without it. 32-bit (i386) and 64-bit (x86-64) architectures are supported.
ARM support is also available as a separate download from the website.


Main Features
=============
* Samples
  supports WAV/AIFF/MP3/MP2/MP1/OGG and custom generated samples

* Sample streams
  stream any sample data in 8/16/32 bit, with both "push" and "pull" systems

* File streams
  MP3/MP2/MP1/OGG/WAV/AIFF file streaming

* Internet file streaming
  stream files from the internet, including Shout/Icecast

* User file streaming
  stream files from anywhere using any delivery method

* OS codecs
  ACM, Media Foundation and CoreAudio codec support for additional audio formats

* Multi-channel streaming
  support for more than plain stereo, including multi-channel OGG/WAV/AIFF files

* MOD music
  uses the same engine as XMPlay = best accuracy, speed, and quality

* MO3 music
  MP3/OGG compressed MOD music

* Add-on system
  support for more formats is available via add-ons (aka plugins)

* Multiple outputs
  simultaneously use multiple soundcards, and move channels between them

* Recording
  flexible recording system, with support for multiple devices

* Decode without playback
  streams and MOD musics can be outputted in any way you want

* Speaker assignment
  assign streams and MOD musics to specific speakers

* High precision synchronization
  synchronize events in your software to the streams and MOD musics

* Effects
  chorus/compressor/distortion/echo/flanger/gargle/parameq/reverb

* User defined DSP functions
  custom effects may be applied to musics and streams

* 32 bit floating-point decoding and processing
  floating-point stream/music decoding, DSP/FX, and recording

* 3D sound
  play samples/streams/musics in any 3D position


Using BASS
==========
There is no guarantee that all future BASS versions will be compatible
with all previous versions, so your program should use BASS_GetVersion
to check the version that is loaded. This also means that you should
put the BASS module in the same directory as your executable (not just
somewhere in the path), to avoid the possibility of a wrong version being
loaded.

If you are updating your software from a previous BASS version, then
you should check the "History" section (below), to see if any of the
functions that you are using have been affected by a change.

Win32 version
-------------
C/C++, Visual Basic, and Delphi APIs and example projects are provided. To
use BASS with another language you will first have to convert the header
file. Or, as a last resort, you could use LoadLibrary and GetProcAddress.

The downside is that you have to manually import each function that you
use, with the GetProcAddress function. But it has been made a lot simpler
to import BASS this way by the use of the BASSDEF #define. Here's a small
example:

#define BASSDEF(f) (WINAPI *f) // define the functions as pointers
#include "bass.h"
...
HINSTANCE bass=LoadLibrary("BASS.DLL"); // load BASS
BASS_Init=GetProcAddress(bass,"BASS_Init"); // get BASS_Init
BASS_Init(-1,44100,0,hWnd,NULL); // call BASS_Init

To use BASS with Borland C++ Builder, you will first have to create a
Borland C++ Builder import library for it. This is done by using the
IMPLIB tool that comes with Borland C++ Builder. Simply execute this:

	IMPLIB BASSBCB.LIB BASS.DLL

... and then use BASSBCB.LIB in your projects to import BASS.

To use BASS with LCC-Win32, you will first have to create a compatible
import library for it. This is done by using the PEDUMP and BUILDLIB
tools that come with LCC-Win32. Run these 2 commands:

	PEDUMP /EXP BASS.LIB > BASSLCC.EXP
	BUILDLIB BASSLCC.EXP BASSLCC.LIB

... and then use BASSLCC.LIB in your projects to import BASS.

For the BASS functions that return strings (char*), VB users should use
the VBStrFromAnsiPtr function to convert the returned pointer into a VB
string.

MacOSX version
--------------
See the example Xcode project and makefiles.

NOTE: The LIBBASS.DYLIB file must be put in the same directory as the
      executable, it can't just be somewhere in the path.

LIBBASS.DYLIB is a universal binary, with support for the i386 and
x86_64 architectures. If only one of those architectures is needed, the
included makefile can be used extract the wanted one. It will also process
any BASS add-ons placed in the same directory. Type "make i386" or
"make x86_64" to extract a particular architecture.

Linux version
-------------
The LIBBASS.SO file needs to be in the OS's library search path for it to
be found; simply placing it in the same directory as the executable won't
necessarily work as it does on other platforms. The BASS libraries should
also not be placed in the standard library directories to avoid version
conflicts. To meet those competing requirements, a wrapper script could be
used to set the "LD_LIBRARY_PATH" environment variable before loading the
executable. Another option is to set the "rpath" in the executable, to tell
it where to look for libraries. That is what the example makefiles do.

When building both 32-bit and 64-bit executables, it is possible to simply
try linking with both LIBBASS.SO versions, and the linker will use the
appropriate version and ignore the other.

Licence
=======
BASS is free for non-commercial use. If you are a non-commercial entity
(eg. an individual) and you are not making any money from your product
(through sales/advertising/etc), then you can use BASS in it for free.
If you wish to use BASS in commercial products, then please also see the
next section.

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, BASS IS PROVIDED
"AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED,
INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY
AND/OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE AUTHORS SHALL NOT BE HELD
LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGE THAT MAY RESULT FROM THE USE OF BASS. YOU USE
BASS ENTIRELY AT YOUR OWN RISK.

Usage of BASS indicates that you agree to the above conditions.

All trademarks and other registered names contained in the BASS
package are the property of their respective owners.

Commercial licensing
--------------------
BASS is available for use in your commercial products. The licence
types available are as follows:

SHAREWARE: Allows the usage of BASS in an unlimited number of your
shareware ("try before you buy") products, which must sell for no more
than 40 Euros each. Non-shareware products are also permitted, but the
product price limit is 10 Euros in that case. The price limit can be
raised by purchasing duplicate licences, eg. 2 licences doubles it. If
you are an individual (not a corporation) making and selling your own
software, this is the licence for you. 

SINGLE COMMERCIAL: Allows the usage of BASS in one commercial product.

UNLIMITED COMMERCIAL: Allows the usage of BASS in an unlimited number
of your commercial products. This licence is on a per-site basis, eg.
if you are creating products with BASS at 2 sites/locations, then 2
licences are required.

Please note the products must be end-user products, eg. not components
used by other products. 

These licences only cover your own software, not the publishing of
other's software. If you publish other's software, its developers (or
the software itself) will need to be licensed to use BASS.

These licences are on a per-platform basis, with reductions available
when licensing for multiple platforms. In all cases there are no royalties
to pay, and you can use future BASS updates without further cost.

These licences do not allow reselling/sublicensing of BASS. For example,
if a product is a development system, the users of said product are not
licensed to use BASS in their productions; they will need their own
licences.

If the standard licences do not meet your requirements, or if you have
any questions, please get in touch (email: bass@un4seen.com).

MP3
---
MP3 technology is patented, and Thomson license the use of their and
Fraunhofer's patents. The inclusion of an MP3 decoder (eg. BASS) in a
commercial product requires an MP3 patent licence. Contact Thomson for
details:

	www.mp3licensing.com

Alternatively, the "MP3-FREE" BASS version does not include its own MP3
decoder but instead makes use of the operating system's already licensed
decoder. If an MP3 decoder is not available, then MP3 playback will not
be possible, but everything else will function as normal.

NOTE: When using the OS's MP3 decoder, BASS still does the file handling
      so all the usual features are still supported, including streaming,
      tag reading, pre-scanning, gapless playback, etc.

NOTE: Linux does not include an MP3 decoder as standard. The "MP3-FREE"
      BASS version will make use of the libmpg123 decoder, if installed.
