This directory contains some simple php scripts for the curlpas demo programs.

If you have a working apache/php installation on your local machine, you can 
copy these scripts to you apache/htdocs/ directory to run the test apps. 

The demo programs "testpost.pas", "testmpf1.pas" and "testmpf2.pas" are 
hard-coded to point to "http://localhost/" , so if you upload the scripts
to a remote machine, you should modify the pascal units accordingly.

FILES - 

testpost.php: 
  Script to test basic HTTP POST variables.

test1867.php: 
  Script to test rfc1867 multipart/form-data posts.
