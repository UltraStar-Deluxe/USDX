This is a demonstration of DCPcrypt working with PHP to encrypt and decrypt
information using the Rijndael (AES) cipher.

encrypttest.php contains the test PHP code to encrypt a couple of sentences
encrypttest.dpr and associated files contain the Delphi code to encrypt and 
    decrypt arbitrary sentences in a way compatible with PHP.
