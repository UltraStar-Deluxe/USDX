   * The UPlatformMacOSX unit takes care of setting paths to resource folders.
   *
   * (Note for non-Maccies: "folder" is the Mac name for directory.)
   *
   * Note on the resource folders:
   *  1. Installation of an application on the mac works as follows: Extract and
   *     copy an application and if you don't like or need the application
   *     anymore you move the folder to the trash - and you're done.
   *  2. The use of folders in the user's home directory is against Apple's
   *     guidelines and strange to an average user.
   *  3. Even worse is using /usr/local/... since all lowercase folders in / are
   *     not visible to an average user in the Finder, at least not without some
   *     "tricks".
   *
   * The best way would be to store everything within the application bundle.
   * However, this requires USDX to offer the handling of the resources. Until
   * this is implemented, the second best solution is as follows:
   *
   * According to Aple guidelines handling of resources and folders should follow
   * these lines:
   *
   * Acceptable places for files are folders named UltraStarDeluxe either in
   *   /Library/Application Support/
   * or
   *   ~/Library/Application Support/
   *
   * So
   * GetGameSharedPath could return
   *   /Library/Application Support/UltraStarDeluxe/.
   * GetGameUserPath could return
   *   ~/Library/Application Support/UltraStarDeluxe/.
   *
   * Right now, only $HOME/Library/Application Support/UltraStarDeluxe
   * is used. So every user needs the complete set of files and folders.
   * Future versions may also use shared resources in
   * /Library/Application Support/UltraStarDeluxe. However, this is
   * not treated yet in the code outside this unit.
   *
   * USDX checks, whether GetGameUserPath exists. If not, USDX creates it.
   * The existence of needed files is then checked and if a file is missing
   * it is copied to there from within the folder Contents in the Application
   * bundle, which contains the default files. USDX should not delete files or
   * folders in Application Support/UltraStarDeluxe automatically or without
   * user confirmation.
   *
   * The log and benchmark files are stored in
   * $HOME/Library/Log/UltraStar Deluxe/
   * 
   * Music should go into ~/Music/UltraStar Deluxe/
   *
   * ~/Library/Application Support/UltraStarDeluxe/songs is also used.
   * The idea is to remove this at some time.
