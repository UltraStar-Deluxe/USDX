- report bugs specific to the unicode branch (cross-check the trunk) at 
  our forum (http://ultrastardeluxe.xtremeweb-hosting.net/)

Microfone playback
- buffers have to be adjusted
  - this may be done automatically (prefer this!)
  - or at least the user has to manually adjust this
- there may be other problems as due to the missing buffer adjustment there were no extensive tests

Theme changes
- there are some problems w/ theme-object positions mainly in the option-screens

There are also assembla tickets that need to be fixed
