Blockers for the outstanding 1.1 release
if you want to help us then start at this tasks

Microfone playback (still experimental, will not be fixed in 1.1)
- buffers have to be adjusted
  - this may be done automatically (prefer this!)
  - or at least the user has to manually adjust this
- there may be other problems as due to the missing buffer adjustment there were no extensive tests

There are also assembla tickets that need to be fixed
