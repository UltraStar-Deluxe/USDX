This test scans through the source files in order to find types
and pointers to types from the pascal port of the ffmpeg
libraries (TAV..., PAV...).

It generates source files for pascal and c that print the sizes
of the types used in the sources.

The concluding comparison shows the size differences between the
pascal types and the c structs:
- type is bigger than struct
- type is smaller than struct

If struct members' names have changed, the compiler will complain.

The test doesn't, however, show if struct members have been swapped
with the size staying exactly the same. Hopefully, that scenario
isn't too likely.

With the exception of the last point, if this test doesn't yield
a result (the types and structs have the same size), it is quite
plausible that the pascal port of the c structs has been done
correctly.
