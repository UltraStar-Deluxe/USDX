\chapter{Importing Songs}

One of the big advantages of UltraStar Deluxe
is the ability to add new songs.
A song contains the music in an \fileending{.mp3} file
and the lyrics and other settings in a \fileending{.txt} file,
known as a lyric file.
For legal copyright reasons,
the \fileending{.mp3} music file cannot be copied from person to person,
but a new \fileending{.txt} file usually can,
as long as the creator of the \fileending{.txt} gives permission, which most do.

\section{Obtaining lyrics files}
New \fileending{.txt} lyrics files are available
and can be downloaded from the UltraStar Deluxe Forums
and are then matched to an \fileending{.mp3} file that you already own.

\section{Creating new lyrics files}

\section{Adding a Song}
\begin{itemize}
\item Ensure that UltraStar Deluxe is not running
\item Under the \todomu{Songs} folder,
	create a new folder with the name of the artist and song title,
	e.g.\@ \todomu{Abba – Dancing Queen (ABBA gold CD album track)}
\item Copy your \fileending{.mp3} file into the new folder
\item Save the lyrics file alongside the audio file in the same folder
\item In the new song folder,
	make sure that the \fileending{.mp3} audio file
	and the \fileending{.txt} lyric file have the same name
\end{itemize}

\chapter{Troubleshooting}

\section{New Song}

When a newly acquired song does not work as it should,
use notepad (or another text editor) to open the \fileending{.txt} lyric file
and perform the following checks:
\begin{itemize}
\item Make sure that the \todomu{\#TITLE}, \todomu{\#ARTIST}, \todomu{\#MP3},
	\todomu{\#BPM} and \todomu{\#GAP} fields
	are all there
	and that there is an \todomu{E}
	at the very end of the file.
\item Make sure that the \todomu{\#MP3} value
	holds the exact filename of the \fileending{.mp3} audio file.
\end{itemize}
If you made any changes,
do not forget to save the file afterwards before retrying.
