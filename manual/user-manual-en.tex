\chapter{Configuration}

Most configuration can be accessed via
\Path[\menu{Tools}]{\menu{Options}},
which provides us with several sub-pages:
\begin{menudescription}
\entry{Game}
	General game settings.
\entry{Graphics}
\entry{Sound}
\entry{Input}
\entry{Lyrics}
\entry{Themes}
	Change the look of UltraStar Deluxe
	by choosing themes, skins and colours.
\entry{Record}
\entry{Advanced}
\entry{Network}
\entry{Webcam}
\entry{Jukebox}
\end{menudescription}

\section{Game}

Here, you can configure general settings of the game.

\begin{menudescription}
\entry{Language}
	The language in which the game is played.
	Contrary to what the in-game help claims,
	the changes go into effect immediately.
\entry{Song Menu}
	The type of menu used to display the available songs
	when choosing what to sing next.
\entry{Tabs}
\entry{Sorting}
\entry{Show Scores}
\entry{Debug}
\entry{Audio/Video Delay}
\entry{Microphone Delay}
\end{menudescription}

\section{Graphics}

\begin{menudescription}
\entry{Fullscreen}
	Disable full screen mode or choose one of two full screen modes.
	This requires a restart,
	other than the full screen hot key
	that immediately toggles between windowed and full screen mode.
\entry{Resolution}
	When \menu{Fullscreen} is \todomu{Off},
	this configures the size of the window.
	When \menu{Fullscreen} is \todomu{On},
	it does weird stuff.
	When \menu{Fullscreen} is \todomu{Borderless},
	it is unavailable.
\entry{Depth}
	The depth option changes the number of colours
	that are used within UltraStar Deluxe.
	Allowed options are:
	\todomu{16 bit} (65\,536 colours)
	and \todomu{32 bit} (4\,294\,967\,296 colours).
	On lower powered systems,
	the higher the colour depth, the slower the performance.
	So if UltraStar Deluxe does not run smoothly,
	change this to \todomu{16 bit}.
\entry{Visualization}
\entry{Oszilloscope}
	The Oscilloscope setting reacts to the microphone input
	and is useful for setting up new songs.
	Therefore leave this option set to \todomu{Off}
	unless a new song is being set up.
	For more information on setting up new songs, see \ref{new_song}.

\chapter{Importing Songs}

One of the big advantages of UltraStar Deluxe
is the ability to add new songs.
A song contains the music in an \fileending{.mp3} file
and the lyrics and other settings in a \fileending{.txt} file,
known as a lyric file.
For legal copyright reasons,
the \fileending{.mp3} music file cannot be copied from person to person,
but a new \fileending{.txt} file usually can,
as long as the creator of the \fileending{.txt} gives permission, which most do.

\section{Obtaining lyrics files}
New \fileending{.txt} lyrics files are available
and can be downloaded from the UltraStar Deluxe Forums
and are then matched to an \fileending{.mp3} file that you already own.

\section{Creating new lyrics files}

\section{Adding a Song}
\begin{itemize}
\item Ensure that UltraStar Deluxe is not running
\item Under the \todomu{Songs} folder,
	create a new folder with the name of the artist and song title,
	e.g.\@ \todomu{Abba â€“ Dancing Queen (ABBA gold CD album track)}
\item Copy your \fileending{.mp3} file into the new folder
\item Save the lyrics file alongside the audio file in the same folder
\item In the new song folder,
	make sure that the \fileending{.mp3} audio file
	and the \fileending{.txt} lyric file have the same name
\end{itemize}

\chapter{Troubleshooting}

\section{New Song}

\label{new_song}

When a newly acquired song does not work as it should,
use notepad (or another text editor) to open the \fileending{.txt} lyric file
and perform the following checks:
\begin{itemize}
\item Make sure that the \todomu{\#TITLE}, \todomu{\#ARTIST}, \todomu{\#MP3},
	\todomu{\#BPM} and \todomu{\#GAP} fields
	are all there
	and that there is an \todomu{E}
	at the very end of the file.
\item Make sure that the \todomu{\#MP3} value
	holds the exact filename of the \fileending{.mp3} audio file.
\end{itemize}
If you made any changes,
do not forget to save the file afterwards before retrying.

\section{Performance}

\subsection{Song Selection}

When the song selection becomes sluggish,
try to chose a different \menu{Song Menu}
in \Path[\menu{Tools}][\menu{Options}]{\menu{Game}}.
