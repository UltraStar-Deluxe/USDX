This game was introduced by Corvus5 writing most of the code by himself.
Based on the official release 0.5.0 Mota and Whiteshark started to add small
patches and modifications and released a package named ultra-star.dl.am Mod.
This modification was continued at Sourceforge.net by the Ultrastar Deluxe Team:
