UltraStar Deluxe (USDX) is a free and open source karaoke game.  It allows
up to six players to sing along with music using microphones in order to
score points, depending on the pitch of the voice and the rhythm of
singing.

UltraStar Deluxe is a fork of the original UltraStar (developed by corvus5).
Many features have been added like party mode, theme support and support
for more audio and video formats.
The improved stability and code quality of USDX enabled ports to Linux and
Mac OS X.
