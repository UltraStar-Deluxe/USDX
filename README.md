### 1. About
UltraStar Deluxe (USDX) is a free and open source karaoke game. It allows up to six players to sing along with music using microphones in order to score points, depending on the pitch of the voice and the rhythm of singing.
UltraStar Deluxe is a fork of the original UltraStar (developed by corvus5).
Many features have been added like party mode, theme support and support for more audio and video formats.
The improved stability and code quality of USDX enabled ports to Linux and Mac OS X.

### 2. Release Notes
- New features contain 6 player on one screen capability, jukebox player, new song selection screen modes (Chessboard, Carousell, Slot machine, Slide, List, Tile), during gameplay you can see on the time bar when there are lyrics to sing, duet mode, new party modes, support for current versions of Microsoft Windows, 
- To set additional song directories change your config.ini like this:
```ini
  [Directories]
  SongDir1=C:\Users\My\Music\MyUSDXSongs
  SongDir2=F:\EvenMoreUSDXSongs
  SongDir...=... (some more directories)
```
- To take a screenshot press _PrintScreen_ key. Screenshots are saved in the directory `screenshots`.
- To enable joypad support change config.ini `Joypad=Off` to `Joypad=On`
- To enable 2 or 3 player each on 2 screens, disable the full screen mode, extend your desktop horizontally and set the resolution to fill one screen. Then, in the config.ini set `Screens=2` and restart the game.
- Press [Shift] + F[1..12] in _NameScreen_ to save the name of a player (alternative use [Shift] instead of [Alt], keep in mind [Alt]+[F4] quits the game on platforms like Windows), press F[1..12] to load the name of a player
- The primary folder for songs on OS X is `$HOME/Music/UltraStar Deluxe`, which is created when UltraStar Deluxe is run for the first time.
- On OS X, by default the `config.ini` file is created in `$HOME/Library/Application Support/UltraStarDeluxe` when UltraStar Deluxe is run for the first time.

### 3. Command-Line Parameters
_Note: This is currently broken / in development._


Command-line parameters are passed to the game adding it to the path of a
shortcut or starting the game within the console.

The following parameters are possible. They can be joined in any possible way.

- `-Benchmark`         : Create a benchmark.log file with start timings.

- `-NoLog`    	       : Do not create any .log files

- `-Joypad`            : Start with joypad support

- `-Language <ID>`     : Load language [ID] on startup.
                         Example: `-Language german`

- `-Songpath <PATH>`   : Same as config Songpath.
                         Example: `-SongPath "C:\Ultrastar Songs"`

- `-ConfigFile <FILE>` : Load configuration file [File] instead of config.ini.
                         The path to the file has to exist.
                         Example: `-ConfigFile config.SongCreation.ini`

- `-ScoreFile <FILE>`  : Use [File] instead of Ultrastar.db
                         The path to the file has to exist.
                         Example: `-ScoreFile HouseParty.db`

- `-FullScreen`        : Start the game in full screen mode

- `-Depth {16|32}`     : Force depth to 16 or 32. Example: `-Depth 16`

- `-Resolution <ID|RESOLUTION>`   : Force resolution. Either by ID (matching an entry of the possible resolution list)
                                    or custom resolution (with the format of `WIDTHxHEIGHT`).
                                    Example: `-Resolution 800x600`

- `-Screens {1|2}`     : Force 1 or 2 screens. Example: `-Screens 2`

Some Examples:

Start with a resolution of 1024x768, a depth of 32 bit and in full screen mode:  
`ultrastar.exe -Resolution 1024x768 -Depth 32 -Fullscreen`

Start without logging and with polish language  
`ultrastar.exe -NoLog -Language polish`

Start with a customs configuration file and score database:  
`ultrastar.exe -ConfigFile "C:\Ultrastar\Configs\PartyConfig.ini" -ScoreFile "C:\Ultrastar\Scores\PartyScores.db"`

### 5. Build and Run
[Freepascal](http://freepascal.org/) 3.0.0 or newer is required to compile UltraStar Deluxe. If you had some older version of fpc installed before, make sure to remove everything of it correctly before trying to install freepascal (otherwise compiling will fail with various weird error messages). Also, using the 3.0-development branch with current fixes is suggested.
If you want to help the project by coding patches, we suggest you to use the [Lazarus 1.6](http://www.lazarus-ide.org/) or newer integrated development environment.
For linking and running the game, the following libraries are also required:
- SDL2, SDL2_image
- ffmpeg 2.8 or older
- sqlite
- [bass](http://www.un4seen.com/bass.html)
- some fonts like ttf-dejavu and ttf-freefont
- portaudio
- lua 5.1 or 5.2 or 5.3
- opencv if you want webcam support
- projectM if you want audio visualisation support

#### Compiling using Lazarus
1. Start Lazarus.
2. Choose Project → Open Project … in the menu bar. A file-dialog box will show.
3. Change to the src subdirectory of your USDX working copy (e.g. ultrastardx/src).
  * If you are running Windows, open the ultrastardx-win.lpi project-file (Preferably use the win32 verison of lazarus, as the included libraries are 32 bit).
  * On Unix-like systems use the ultrastardx-unix.lpi file.
4. Now you can compile USDX by choosing the menu entry Run → Build or pressing Ctrl+F9.
8. If you want to compile and/or start USDX directly choose Run → Run or press F9.

#### Compiling on Linux/BSD using make
1. make sure all required libraries are installed 
  * for current debian / ubuntu: 
    `sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install git automake make gcc fpc libsdl2-image-dev libavformat-dev libswscale-dev libsqlite3-dev libfreetype6-dev portaudio19-dev libportmidi-dev liblua5.3-dev libopencv-highgui-dev`
  * if you want to build --with-libprojectM, you also need
    `sudo apt-get install g++ libprojectm-dev`
  * for Fedora with RPM Fusion:
    `sudo dnf install git automake make gcc fpc SDL2_image-devel ffmpeg-devel sqlite-devel freetype-devel portaudio-devel portmidi-devel lua-devel opencv-devel`
    and to be able to use --with-libprojectM:
    `sudo dnf install gcc-c++ libprojectM-devel`
  * for arch linux there is an aur package called [ultrastardx-git](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/ultrastardx-git)
2. `git clone https://github.com/UltraStar-Deluxe/USDX`
2. `cd USDX`
4. `./autogen.sh`
5. `./configure` (or use _autoconf_)
6. `make`
7. Play the game, 
   * install the game and start it
     - `sudo make install`
