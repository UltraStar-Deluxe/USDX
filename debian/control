Description: Free and Open Source karaoke game
 A karaoke game similar to SingStar™ where one or more players perform a song
 and the game scores their performances, depending on the pitch of the voice
 and the rythm of singing. It's a fork of the original UltraStar game with many
 added features like party mode, theme support and support for more audio and
 video formats. Supports all microphones, even from SingStar™. Songs are
 transcribed in its own UltraStar dialect.
